# My-Retail-analytics

Retail Analytics Capstone

one linear: Interactive retail analytics dashboard and analysis to uncover customer behavior, seasonal sales patterns, and product performance using multi-source transactional data.

Overview

Built an end-to-end analytics workflow using SQL, Python (pandas, matplotlib), and Power BI. The project cleans and merges 9 datasets (Customers, Orders, Order Items, Payments, Reviews, Products, Sellers, Geolocation, Product Categories), performs exploratory analysis, and delivers a Power BI dashboard with actionable KPIs to support inventory planning and revenue optimization.

Tech stack
	•	Tools: Power BI, Jupyter Notebook, GitHub
	•	Languages / Libraries: SQL, Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
	•	Files: CSV datasets (sample), notebooks, dashboards (PBIX screenshots)

Key steps
	1.	Data ingestion & profiling (identify missing values, duplicates).
	2.	Data cleaning & transformation with Python (standardize dates, join tables).
	3.	SQL analysis for high-performance aggregations (top products, quarter-wise sales).
	4.	Built interactive Power BI reports for stakeholder-ready visuals.
	5.	Documented key business insights and recommended actions.

Key findings (examples)
	•	Top 10 products contributed X% of revenue — focus inventory on these SKUs.
	•	Sales show clear seasonality: Q4 peak; promotional windows increase conversion by Y%.
	•	Customer segmentation identified Z% of repeat buyers responsible for most lifetime value.
